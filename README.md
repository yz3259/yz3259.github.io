(June. 2020)Research competition

* Worked in a team of 4 and build a Bayesian spatial-temporal model to understand the impact of over 6 different pollutant species and other 20 social and cultural factors on the impact of spreading of COVID-19 in US, Italy, and UK. 

* NERC and UKRI have asked us for permission to use our research results for government policy consulting.
